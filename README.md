## **Build Instructions**

Follow these steps to set up the **Precise-Open API** locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/precise-open-api.git
   cd precise-open-api
   ```

2. **Install Rust**:
   Ensure you have Rust installed. If not, download it [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   rustup update
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Use `cargo` to fetch and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
   ```
   --release and --target flag is needed to build binary accordingly to lambdas environment 

4. **Run Tests**:
   Verify the setup by running tests:
   ```bash
   cargo test
   ```

## **Run Locally**

1. **Start the API**:
   ```bash
   cargo run --release
   or
   sam local start-api --env-vars env.json
   ```

2. **Access the API**:
   By default, the API runs on `http://127.0.0.1:3000`. You can interact with the endpoints using tools like `curl`, Postman, or connect your webapp.

3. **Example Request**:
   ```bash
   curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:3000/tokeninfo?token_id=HeLp6NuQkmYB4pYWo2zYs22mESHXPQYzXbB8n4V98jwC
   ```
